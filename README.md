# Genetic Algorithm for Optimization

### Overview
This Jupyter Notebook, `genetic_algorithm.ipynb`, demonstrates a genetic algorithm's application in optimization problems, including detailed implementations of its components.

### Key Features
1. **Fitness Function**: Evaluates the fitness of chromosomes.
2. **Population Initialization**: Generates an initial population of binary chromosomes.
3. **Roulette Wheel Selection**: Chooses chromosomes for breeding based on fitness.
4. **Single-Point Crossover**: Produces offspring from two parent chromosomes.
5. **Bitwise Mutation**: Introduces variations by flipping chromosome bits.
6. **Genetic Algorithm Execution**: Main loop for evolving the population towards optimal solutions.

### Dependencies
- `numpy`
